IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing


In the deliverable 2, CitySim9002Test and VisitorTest to test the CitySim9002 project. There are several test cases. “testCheckInput” is to test if different input will get certain feedback. Such as testCheckInput2 uses two integers to test if system will return false when the correct input is an integer. Using “testGetType” to test if we can get the certain visitor type we set. 

The problem I met in this deliverable is that I want to test the negative input and large input such as 100 to test if the system can return correct value but these two test cases failed when I test them. I do not know the problem and I will keep working.
